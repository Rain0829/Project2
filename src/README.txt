Write a new method in the CustomHashTable class called rehash, which is because there is not enough default capacity, we need to extend that. Rehashing is create a new customHashTable and rehash everything.
Update the insert method in the CustomHashTable. Will rehash when reach the half of maximum capacity.
In the ReadFile class, we put all lines of text file into a list, and put each line into a response. It will split each answer by the space.
Only constructor and getter in the Response class.

Work division: both members split the work roughly evenly, mostly meeting up and co-working on the program
at the same time, utilizing Intellij's Code With Me feature. We both sought out TAs during Lab for clarifications/.
For example, for mostCommonSymptoms, we were unsure to include "none of the above" or not. When not together, work
load was divided, such as debugging or testing our program. In all cases, both members filled each other in
and explained any changed they committed and pushed.
